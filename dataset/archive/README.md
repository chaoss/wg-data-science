# Archival of Open Source Projects (aka Sudden Archival)

Archival is often used as an indicator that a project is no longer being maintained and will not be updated (including security updates). We know that a lot of projects are archived when they are abandoned and people stop working on them, but what about projects that are archived for other reasons?

More Details about this project:
* Tracked in [Issue #45](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science/issues/45)
* [Project Planning document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18audPynKQg_n7ZdspeUGtPSF7cMzc9O7CVcrEdJAhtk/edit?usp=sharing)
* [WIP datasets](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science/tree/main/dataset/archive)
  * data-files/archive_repos.csv: contains 733 repos - all GH repos with > 1000 stars and > 100 forks with an open source license. 
  * archived_projects.py: the script containing the GraphQL API query to generate data-files/archive_repos.csv

Current status:
* Initial [WIP datasets](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science/tree/main/dataset/archive) being gathered.
* We'll start this project in June during the [Data Science Hackathon](https://chaoss.community/chaoss-data-science-hackathon-2025/), so the current work will be in getting the initial dataset organized and into a format that will be useful in a hackathon setting.
