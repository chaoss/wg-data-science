# Foundation Stats Project: Mapping Collaboration Pathways in Open Source Communities
## A CHAOSS-Aligned, Reproducible Assessment of Community Health

This project is part of the [CHAOSS Data Science Working Group](https://chaoss.community/inside-the-chaoss-data-science-working-group/) initiative to develop rigorous, evidence-based statistical frameworks for understanding collaboration patterns across major open source foundations.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This research project conducts a comprehensive, reproducible assessment of community health across three major open source ecosystems: **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**, **Apache Software Foundation**, and **Eclipse Foundation**. 

Our goal is to map collaboration pathways by combining metadata analysis, engagement modeling, and predictive insights to understand what drives successful community participation in open source projects.

### Why This Matters

Open source foundations manage thousands of projects, but lack systematic approaches to:

- **Compare health metrics** across different governance models and ecosystems  
- **Predict engagement outcomes** based on project infrastructure and communication patterns
- **Identify at-risk projects** before they become inactive or lose contributors
- **Provide evidence-based guidance** to maintainers and foundation leadership

This research addresses these gaps through transparent, reproducible methodology aligned with CHAOSS metrics.

## 🔬 Research Methodology

Our analysis follows a six-section research design that builds from descriptive statistics to predictive modeling:

### 1. CHAOSS-Aligned Metadata Audit
- Field-level presence analysis across foundations
- Alignment with CHAOSS metric categories  
- Completeness benchmarking and structural gap identification

### 2. Foundation-Specific Narratives
- Programming language ecosystem analysis
- Communication infrastructure presence (chat, blogs)
- Contributor and repository distribution patterns

### 3. Cross-Foundation Outlier Analysis  
- Statistical outlier detection using z-scores and IQR methods
- Foundation-specific reporting gap analysis
- "Risk by absence" identification (high-activity projects missing key infrastructure)

### 4. Aggregate Landscape Summary
- Ecosystem-wide benchmarking across all three foundations
- Maturity stage distributions and technology trends
- Global summary metrics for stakeholder reference

### 5. Predictive and Stochastic Modeling
- **Communication state transition modeling** using Markov chains
- **Monte Carlo simulations** to estimate engagement pathways
- **Topic modeling** and content-based engagement prediction
- **Panel regression models** (Poisson, Zero-Inflated Poisson) for explanatory analysis

### 6. Actionable Insights and Recommendations
- Project classification into engagement tiers (Healthy, At-Risk, Inactive)
- Foundation-specific gap analysis and improvement recommendations
- Stakeholder-specific recommendation matrix
