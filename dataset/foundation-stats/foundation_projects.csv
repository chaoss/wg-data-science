In business, we increasingly see blogs and wikis demonstrating utility in problem solving and communications but the real time nature of business process problem solving largely remains untouched by social networking tools. Existing services, while attractive do not scale well and have proven unreliable. This is unacceptable to business which must be 'Always On' and able to support people in their daily working lives. Such applications must therefore be scalable and reliable but also provide a lot more.
When solving problems, how good might it be if a user was able to tap into the collective knowledge of her peers or surrounding groups of people with whom she might naturally network in the workplace setting?

	Unlike other approaches Empire-db does not rely on Java Annotations or Mapping-files
	for building queries but rather uses a Java Object model that is easy to access and
	extend. For Data Access and Data Interchange developers can choose between traditional 
	Java Beans and a more sophisticated dynamic interface provided by Record and

      protocol (whereever the HTTP protocol could also be used). It provides
      both RETR/REST retrieval and STOR/APPE upload, using the same user/permissions
      model as httpd (so it shares the same security considerations as mod_dav
      plus mod_dav_fs).

knox,Apache Knox,big-data,"The Apache Knox Gateway is a REST API Gateway for interacting with Hadoop clusters.

The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for all REST interactions with Hadoop clusters.

In this capacity, the Knox Gateway is able to provide valuable functionality to aid in the control,
integration, monitoring and automation of critical administrative and analytical needs of the enterprise.

Authentication (LDAP and Active Directory Authentication Provider)
Federation/SSO (HTTP Header Based Identity Federation)
Authorization (Service Level Authorization)
Auditing
While there are a number of benefits for unsecured Hadoop clusters,
the Knox Gateway also complements the kerberos secured cluster quite nicely.

Coupled with proper network isolation of a Kerberos secured Hadoop cluster,

lucenenet-lucenedotnet,Apache Lucene.Net,database,"Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and targeted at .NET runtime users. The Lucene search library is based on an inverted index. Lucene.Net has three primary goals:

1. Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize with the Java Lucene release schedule;
2. Maintaining the high-performance requirements expected of a first class C# search engine library;
3. Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.

poi-xmlbeans,Apache XMLBeans,xml,"XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power of XML in a Java friendly way. The idea
            is that you can take advantage of the richness and features of XML and XML Schema and have these features
            mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML
            Schema to compile Java interfaces and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance data.
            Using XMLBeans is similar to using any other Java interface/class, you will see things like getFoo or setFoo
            just as you would expect when working with Java. While a major use of XMLBeans is to access your XML
            instance data with strongly typed Java classes there are also API's that allow you access to the full XML
            infoset (XMLBeans keeps XML Infoset fidelity) as well as to allow you to reflect into the XML schema itself
            through an XML Schema Object model.

            For more details on XMLBeans see the XMLBeans Wiki pages or the XMLBeans documentation (the Documentation
            tab on this website).
            What Makes XMLBeans Different

            There are at least two major things that make XMLBeans unique from other XML-Java binding options.

            1. Full XML Schema support. XMLBeans fully supports XML Schema and the corresponding java classes provide
            constructs for all of the major functionality of XML Schema. This is critical since often times you do not
            have control over the features of XML Schema that you need to work with in Java. Also, XML Schema oriented
            applications can take full advantage of the power of XML Schema and not have to restrict themselvs to a
            subset.
            2. Full XML Infoset fidelity.When unmarshalling an XML instance the full XML infoset is kept and is
            available to the developer. This is critical because because of the subset of XML that is not easily
            represented in java. For example, order of the elements or comments might be needed in a particular
            application.

            A major objective of XMLBeans has been to be applicable in all non-streaming (in memory) XML programming
            situations. You should be able to compile your XML Schema into a set of java classes and know that 1) you
            will be able to use XMLBeans for all of the schemas you encounter (even the warped ones) and 2) that you
            will be able to get to the XML at whatever level is necessary - and not have to resort to multple tools to
            do this.

            To accomplish this XMLBeans provides three major APIs:

            * XmlObject The java classes that are generated from an XML Schema are all derived from XmlObject. These
            provide strongly typed getters and setters for each of the elements within the defined XML. Complex types
            are in turn XmlObjects. For example getCustomer might return a CustomerType (which is an XmlObject). Simple
            types turn into simple getters and setters with the correct java type. For example getName might return a
            String.
            * XmlCursor From any XmlObject you can get an XmlCursor. This provides efficient, low level access to the
            XML Infoset. A cursor represents a position in the XML instance. You can move the cursor around the XML
            instance at any level of granularity you need from individual characters to Tokens.
            * SchemaType XMLBeans provides a full XML Schema object model that you can use to reflect on the underlying
            schema meta information. For example, you might want to generate a sample XML instance for an XML schema or
            perhaps find the enumerations for an element so that you can display them.

            All of this was built with performance in mind. Informal benchmarks and user feedback indicate that XMLBeans
            is extremely fast.

            A major objective of XMLBeans has been to be applicable in all non-streaming (in memory) XML programming
            situations. You should be able to compile your XML Schema into a set of java classes and know that 1) you
            will be able to use XMLBeans for all of the schemas you encounter (even the warped ones) and 2) that you
            will be able to get to the XML at whatever level is necessary - and not have to resort to multple tools to
            do this.

            To accomplish this XMLBeans provides three major APIs:

            * XmlObject The java classes that are generated from an XML Schema are all derived from XmlObject. These
            provide strongly typed getters and setters for each of the elements within the defined XML. Complex types
            are in turn XmlObjects. For example getCustomer might return a CustomerType (which is an XmlObject). Simple
            types turn into simple getters and setters with the correct java type. For example getName might return a
            String.
            * XmlCursor From any XmlObject you can get an XmlCursor. This provides efficient, low level access to the
            XML Infoset. A cursor represents a position in the XML instance. You can move the cursor around the XML
            instance at any level of granularity you need from individual characters to Tokens.
            * SchemaType XMLBeans provides a full XML Schema object model that you can use to reflect on the underlying
            schema meta information. For example, you might want to generate a sample XML instance for an XML schema or
            perhaps find the enumerations for an element so that you can display them.

            All of this was built with performance in mind. Informal benchmarks and user feedback indicate that XMLBeans
            is extremely fast.

            What Makes XMLBeans Different

            There are at least two major things that make XMLBeans unique from other XML-Java binding options.

            1. Full XML Schema support. XMLBeans fully supports XML Schema and the corresponding java classes provide
            constructs for all of the major functionality of XML Schema. This is critical since often times you do not
            have control over the features of XML Schema that you need to work with in Java. Also, XML Schema oriented
            applications can take full advantage of the power of XML Schema and not have to restrict themselvs to a
            subset.
            2. Full XML Infoset fidelity.When unmarshalling an XML instance the full XML infoset is kept and is
            available to the developer. This is critical because because of the subset of XML that is not easily
            represented in java. For example, order of the elements or comments might be needed in a particular
            application.

            There are at least two major things that make XMLBeans unique from other XML-Java binding options.

            1. Full XML Schema support. XMLBeans fully supports XML Schema and the corresponding java classes provide
            constructs for all of the major functionality of XML Schema. This is critical since often times you do not
            have control over the features of XML Schema that you need to work with in Java. Also, XML Schema oriented
            applications can take full advantage of the power of XML Schema and not have to restrict themselvs to a
            subset.
            2. Full XML Infoset fidelity.When unmarshalling an XML instance the full XML infoset is kept and is
            available to the developer. This is critical because because of the subset of XML that is not easily
            represented in java. For example, order of the elements or comments might be needed in a particular
            application.

            A major objective of XMLBeans has been to be applicable in all non-streaming (in memory) XML programming
            situations. You should be able to compile your XML Schema into a set of java classes and know that 1) you
            will be able to use XMLBeans for all of the schemas you encounter (even the warped ones) and 2) that you
            will be able to get to the XML at whatever level is necessary - and not have to resort to multple tools to
            do this.

            To accomplish this XMLBeans provides three major APIs:

            * XmlObject The java classes that are generated from an XML Schema are all derived from XmlObject. These
            provide strongly typed getters and setters for each of the elements within the defined XML. Complex types
            are in turn XmlObjects. For example getCustomer might return a CustomerType (which is an XmlObject). Simple
            types turn into simple getters and setters with the correct java type. For example getName might return a
            String.
            * XmlCursor From any XmlObject you can get an XmlCursor. This provides efficient, low level access to the
            XML Infoset. A cursor represents a position in the XML instance. You can move the cursor around the XML
            instance at any level of granularity you need from individual characters to Tokens.
            * SchemaType XMLBeans provides a full XML Schema object model that you can use to reflect on the underlying
            schema meta information. For example, you might want to generate a sample XML instance for an XML schema or
            perhaps find the enumerations for an element so that you can display them.

            All of this was built with performance in mind. Informal benchmarks and user feedback indicate that XMLBeans
            is extremely fast.

            mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML
            Schema to compile Java interfaces and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance data.
            Using XMLBeans is similar to using any other Java interface/class, you will see things like getFoo or setFoo
            just as you would expect when working with Java. While a major use of XMLBeans is to access your XML
            instance data with strongly typed Java classes there are also API's that allow you access to the full XML
            infoset (XMLBeans keeps XML Infoset fidelity) as well as to allow you to reflect into the XML schema itself
            through an XML Schema Object model.

            For more details on XMLBeans see the XMLBeans Wiki pages or the XMLBeans documentation (the Documentation
            tab on this website).
            What Makes XMLBeans Different

            There are at least two major things that make XMLBeans unique from other XML-Java binding options.

            1. Full XML Schema support. XMLBeans fully supports XML Schema and the corresponding java classes provide
            constructs for all of the major functionality of XML Schema. This is critical since often times you do not
            have control over the features of XML Schema that you need to work with in Java. Also, XML Schema oriented
            applications can take full advantage of the power of XML Schema and not have to restrict themselvs to a
            subset.
            2. Full XML Infoset fidelity.When unmarshalling an XML instance the full XML infoset is kept and is
            available to the developer. This is critical because because of the subset of XML that is not easily
            represented in java. For example, order of the elements or comments might be needed in a particular
            application.

            A major objective of XMLBeans has been to be applicable in all non-streaming (in memory) XML programming
            situations. You should be able to compile your XML Schema into a set of java classes and know that 1) you
            will be able to use XMLBeans for all of the schemas you encounter (even the warped ones) and 2) that you
            will be able to get to the XML at whatever level is necessary - and not have to resort to multple tools to
            do this.

            To accomplish this XMLBeans provides three major APIs:

            * XmlObject The java classes that are generated from an XML Schema are all derived from XmlObject. These
            provide strongly typed getters and setters for each of the elements within the defined XML. Complex types
            are in turn XmlObjects. For example getCustomer might return a CustomerType (which is an XmlObject). Simple
            types turn into simple getters and setters with the correct java type. For example getName might return a
            String.
            * XmlCursor From any XmlObject you can get an XmlCursor. This provides efficient, low level access to the
            XML Infoset. A cursor represents a position in the XML instance. You can move the cursor around the XML
            instance at any level of granularity you need from individual characters to Tokens.
            * SchemaType XMLBeans provides a full XML Schema object model that you can use to reflect on the underlying
            schema meta information. For example, you might want to generate a sample XML instance for an XML schema or
            perhaps find the enumerations for an element so that you can display them.

            All of this was built with performance in mind. Informal benchmarks and user feedback indicate that XMLBeans
            is extremely fast.

turbine,Apache Turbine,web-framework," Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java developers to quickly build web applications. Turbine allows you to use personalize the web sites and to use user logins to restrict access to parts of your application.

Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as the base of many other projects (like e.g. the excellent Jetspeed 1 Portals framework.

Turbine is an excellent choice for developing applications that make use of a services-oriented architecture. Some of the functionality provided with Turbine includes a security management system, a scheduling service, XML-defined form validation server, and an XML-RPC service for web services. It is a simple task to create new services particular to your application.

The Turbine core is free of any dependency on a presentation layer technology. Both JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Velocity are supported inside Turbine. For developers already familiar with JSP, or have existing JSP tag libraries, Turbine offers support for the Sun standard. Velocity is the favorite view technology of most users of the Turbine framework; try it out and see if Velocity can help you develop your web applications faster and work more easily with non-programming designers.

Turbine is developed in an open, participatory environment and released under the Apache Software License. Turbine is intended to be a collaboration of the best-of-breed developers from around the world. We invite you to participate in this open development project.

Basically the server tracks users using different mechanisms (by default cookies), builds a progressively populated profile and associates events that are performed by a user with his profile. Events may range from a click on a page, to a file being downloaded, a native mobile application button being clicked, or anything that can be sent to the server.

The server has a built-in rule system that makes it possible to perform any action when an event is collected for a profile. It also has the notion of user segments, making it possible to classify user profiles into dynamic sub-groups, notably to build personalized experiences for specific segments.",https://unomi.apache.org/assets/doap_Unomi.rdf,https://unomi.apache.org/download.html,https://unomi.apache.org,https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0,Java,https://unomi.apache.org/community/index.html,['https://github.com/apache/unomi'],https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/UNOMI/,,,2.5.0,2024-06-12

     Xerces-J is a high performance, fully compliant validating XML parser written in Java. It is a fully conforming XML Schema processor that includes a complete implementation of the Document Object Model Level 3 Core and Load/Save W3C Recommendations and provides a complete implementation of the XML Inclusions (XInclude) W3C Recommendation. It also provides support for OASIS XML Catalogs v1.1. 
     Xerces 2.x introduced the Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework for building parser components and configurations that is extremely modular and easy to program. XNI is merely an internal set of interfaces. There is no need for an XML application programmer to learn XNI if they only intend to interface to the Xerces2 parser using standard interfaces like JAXP, DOM, and SAX. Xerces developers and application developers that need more power and flexibility than that provided by the standard interfaces should read and understand XNI.

xerces-for_perl_xml_parser,Apache Xerces for Perl XML Parser,xml," XML::Xerces is the Perl API to the Apache project's Xerces XML parser. It is implemented using the Xerces C++ API, and it provides access to most of the C++ API from Perl.
    Because it is based on Xerces-C, XML::Xerces provides a validating XML parser that makes it easy to give your application the ability to read and write XML data. Classes are provided for parsing, generating, manipulating, and validating XML documents. XML::Xerces is faithful to the XML 1.0 and 1.1 recommendations and associated standards (DOM levels 1, 2, and 3, SAX 1 and 2, Namespaces, and W3C XML Schema). The parser provides high performance, modularity, and scalability, and provides full support for Unicode.
    XML::Xerces implements the vast majority of the Xerces-C API (if you notice any discrepancies please mail the list). The exception is some functions in the C++ API which either have better Perl counterparts (such as file I/O) or which manipulate internal C++ information that has no role in the Perl module.
    The majority of the API is created automatically using Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator (SWIG). However, care has been taken to make most method invocations natural to perl programmers, so a number of rough C++ edges have been smoothed over (See the Special Perl API Features section).
