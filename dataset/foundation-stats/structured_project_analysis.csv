    Provides a model for creating composite applications by defining the services in the fabric and their relationships with one another. The services can be implemented in any technology.
    Enables service developers to create reusable services that only contain business logic. Protocols are pushed out of business logic and are handled through pluggable bindings. This lowers development cost.
    Applications can easily adapt to infrastructure changes without recoding since protocols are handled via pluggable bindings and quality of services (transaction, security) are handled declaratively.
    Existing applications can work with new SCA compositions. This allows for incremental growth towards a more flexible architecture, outsourcing or providing services to others.

projects,Apache XMLBeans,Apache XMLBeans,xml,"XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power of XML in a Java friendly way. The idea
            is that you can take advantage of the richness and features of XML and XML Schema and have these features
            mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML
            Schema to compile Java interfaces and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance data.
            Using XMLBeans is similar to using any other Java interface/class, you will see things like getFoo or setFoo
            just as you would expect when working with Java. While a major use of XMLBeans is to access your XML
            instance data with strongly typed Java classes there are also API's that allow you access to the full XML
            infoset (XMLBeans keeps XML Infoset fidelity) as well as to allow you to reflect into the XML schema itself
            through an XML Schema Object model.

            For more details on XMLBeans see the XMLBeans Wiki pages or the XMLBeans documentation (the Documentation
            tab on this website).
            What Makes XMLBeans Different

            There are at least two major things that make XMLBeans unique from other XML-Java binding options.

            1. Full XML Schema support. XMLBeans fully supports XML Schema and the corresponding java classes provide
            constructs for all of the major functionality of XML Schema. This is critical since often times you do not
            have control over the features of XML Schema that you need to work with in Java. Also, XML Schema oriented
            applications can take full advantage of the power of XML Schema and not have to restrict themselvs to a
            subset.
            2. Full XML Infoset fidelity.When unmarshalling an XML instance the full XML infoset is kept and is
            available to the developer. This is critical because because of the subset of XML that is not easily
            represented in java. For example, order of the elements or comments might be needed in a particular
            application.

            A major objective of XMLBeans has been to be applicable in all non-streaming (in memory) XML programming
            situations. You should be able to compile your XML Schema into a set of java classes and know that 1) you
            will be able to use XMLBeans for all of the schemas you encounter (even the warped ones) and 2) that you
            will be able to get to the XML at whatever level is necessary - and not have to resort to multple tools to
            do this.

            To accomplish this XMLBeans provides three major APIs:

            * XmlObject The java classes that are generated from an XML Schema are all derived from XmlObject. These
            provide strongly typed getters and setters for each of the elements within the defined XML. Complex types
            are in turn XmlObjects. For example getCustomer might return a CustomerType (which is an XmlObject). Simple
            types turn into simple getters and setters with the correct java type. For example getName might return a
            String.
            * XmlCursor From any XmlObject you can get an XmlCursor. This provides efficient, low level access to the
            XML Infoset. A cursor represents a position in the XML instance. You can move the cursor around the XML
            instance at any level of granularity you need from individual characters to Tokens.
            * SchemaType XMLBeans provides a full XML Schema object model that you can use to reflect on the underlying
            schema meta information. For example, you might want to generate a sample XML instance for an XML schema or
            perhaps find the enumerations for an element so that you can display them.

            All of this was built with performance in mind. Informal benchmarks and user feedback indicate that XMLBeans
            is extremely fast.

Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as the base of many other projects (like e.g. the excellent Jetspeed 1 Portals framework.

Turbine is an excellent choice for developing applications that make use of a services-oriented architecture. Some of the functionality provided with Turbine includes a security management system, a scheduling service, XML-defined form validation server, and an XML-RPC service for web services. It is a simple task to create new services particular to your application.

The Turbine core is free of any dependency on a presentation layer technology. Both JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Velocity are supported inside Turbine. For developers already familiar with JSP, or have existing JSP tag libraries, Turbine offers support for the Sun standard. Velocity is the favorite view technology of most users of the Turbine framework; try it out and see if Velocity can help you develop your web applications faster and work more easily with non-programming designers.

Turbine is developed in an open, participatory environment and released under the Apache Software License. Turbine is intended to be a collaboration of the best-of-breed developers from around the world. We invite you to participate in this open development project.
