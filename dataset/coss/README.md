# Commercial Open Source Software (COSS) Project

The goal of this project is to build a dataset of commercial open source companies that can be used as the basis for additional CHAOSS Data Science research. This is a joint effort between CHAOSS and the [Commercial Open Source Startup Alliance (COSSA)](https://cossa.io/).

The data and more details are coming soon.
