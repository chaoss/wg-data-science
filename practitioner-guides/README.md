# Practitioner Guides

Practitioner Guides are designed to be used by practitioners who may not be experts in data analysis or open source. The goal is to help people understand how to interpret the data about an open source project to develop insights that can help improve the project health of an open source project. 

## Audience for the Guides

Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), project leads, community managers, maintainers, and anyone who wants to better understand project health and take action on what they learn from their metrics.

Note that while these guides are being developed within the Data Science WG, we are not the audience for these guides. The guides should be written with the above audience of practitioners in mind.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to work on a guide or propose a new guide, you can browse the [Practitioner Guide issues](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22practitioner+guide%22) in the data science WG repo. We have some issues for guides that we know we want, but that have no yet been started, and you can create a new issue using our template to propose a new Practitioner Guide.

A few things to keep in mind when contributing to these guides:
* We have a Google Docs [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xe3KkkoBHcn9tyFaMTQ0TIfzZGkJPzBvrravp8Cdtl4/edit?usp=sharing) that you should use when creating a new guide to make it easier for others to review and collaborate with you. We prefer for this document to be owned by the chaossproject@gmail.com account. You should link to your document from the GitHub issue.
* Make sure that all links to metrics and metrics models use the permanent, non-changing link in the form of `https://chaoss.community/?p=####`. These links can be found near the end of every published metric.
* Each Insight Guide should contain no more than 4 metrics. Pick the 2-4 metrics that best represent the breadth of the topic and list additional metrics in Step 3. 
* Please read the [Practitioner Guide: Introduction](introduction.md) before starting and link to it rather than duplicating where possible. Note that some duplication is likely required for clarity in the individual guides.
* To see an example of how this template looks when completed, see the [Responsiveness](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bRe7m-kIr208H_MaubbU87QIJZJ18wc_g0mN_cEXO_c/edit) Guide.
